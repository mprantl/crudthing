## Crudthing
----
Basic cross-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) Tauri desktop application with a Sqlite database, a Rust backend and a Svelte frontend.
The backend implements CRUD functionality handler functions. Those get called from frontend functions via the GUI. 
This project does not have a use-case other than to serve as a proof of concept/Showcase on which will be expanded upon.
